## Getting Started

Hi, there. Please watch these amazing guys from Tuva [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bDntRWfL70) and 
another piece of music [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRU1o-sCnqY) recommended by Edward first 
before we start working on our amazing project. 

Before getting started, you are required to 

1. Understand how to pull and push our project, with careful comments on every change on the 
project you have made when pushing (in either Chinese or English). Github Desktop is highly recommended if you 
don't like command line operations. **Most importantly, you are required to understand how to 
deal with conflicts**, which means that you would not override/delete others' changes and reinvent the wheels. 


2. Take this project as our joint responsibility, willing to offer advice and open to others' comments.  

That's all we need. Here are some doc files on which we will be collaborating soon.
