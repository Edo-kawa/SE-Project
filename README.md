# Software Engineering Project

Hi, there. Please watch these amazing guys from Tuva [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bDntRWfL70) and another piece of music [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvl7IEqtcz4) recommended by Edokawa first before we start working on our amazing project. 

Before getting started, you are required to 

1. Understand how to pull and push our project, with careful comments on every change on the 
the project you have made when pushing (in either Chinese or English). Github Desktop is highly recommended if you 
don't like command line operations. 

2. Take this project as our joint responsibility, willing to offer advice and open to others' comments.  

That's all we need. Here are some doc files on which we will be collaborating soon.
